##Hannah:
Discover Your Palindromes

A static web application built with Javascript and Bootstrap5. The form takes in a string and evaluates the input to see if its is a palindrome. For example the word TACOCAT reversed represents the same word.

###Project Screen Shot(s)

###Hosting
Example:
[Architecture](./documentation/images/s3-archtiecture.png)

This application is hosted by AWS using CloudFront CDN and S3 for static files. By using AWS I can demonstrate my architecture knowledge and application deployments. In addition, the solution is cost-effective and free considering its utilization.
###Reflection
This was a small Javascript project to visually solve the common coding algorithm challange of checking if a string is a palindrome or not.
By creating a visual project, I can demonstrate the ability to package a problem into a solution and to give a live example of such problem with a working solution.
