##Hannah:
Solve Palindromes

A static web application built with Javascript and Bootstrap5. The form takes in a string and evaluates the input to see if its is a palindrome. For example the word TACOCAT reversed represents the same word.

###Reflection
This was a small Javascript project to visualy solve the common coding algorithm challange of checking if a string is a palindrome or not.
By creating a visual project, I can demonstrate the ability to package a problem into a solution and to give a live example of such problem with a working solution.
